TODO:

- check integrity check boot entry
    remove "splash quiet"?
    fsck.check=force?
    reboot after checking
- run appImage instead and reduce size?
    - auto-check and fetch latest version?

=============
cryptmount

- mount from script
    cryptmount --passwd-fd 5 jsun_test 5< <(echo eroas)

- empty password is allowed
    cryptmount --passwd-fd 5 jsun_test 5< <(echo )

- another way
    exec 10<<<"eroas"
    cryptmount --passwd-fd 10 jsun_test

==========

Tails OS

- partition : GPT with protective MBR
    no real MBR

- single EFI partition that has
    EFI/{BOOT,debian}
    isolinux

==========
compare to tails OS

- smaller size
    EROAS only needs 2GB USB
    tails OS needs > 12GB?

- extra partition for data exchange
    workaround in tails OS
        boot up tails OS without configuring persistence partition
            allow main partition to expand to 8GB
        use gparted to add fat32 data exchange partition with desired size
        boot up tails OS again and configure persistence partition
            it will take up the remaining space on the disk

- annoying pop-up about formatting partitions
    WIP

- tail os has more programs and is multi-purposed

- tail os has configurable persistency for user data

- tail os has tor browser
    TODO

- tail os has tor network only
    TODO?

- tail os allow root user and mutation of system image
    anyone who access USB can install software

- eroas has much restrictive networking control

==========
grub2 install

https://www.runscripts.com/support/guides/tools/multiboot-usb/grub2-install

options:
--removable : install fallback bootloader, needed for USB
--target=x86_64-efi

explain 3 modes grub2 support: i386-pc x86_64-efi i386-efi
